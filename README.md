## Introduction
Built an app for **fitness enthusiasts** and their **tracking of Body Mass Index**. It would be overall beneficial for the user's health and fitness goals.

### Body Mass Index
Body mass index (BMI) is a **measure of body fat** based on **height** and **weight** that applies to adult men and women.

`BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2`

BMI is a screening tool, not a diagnostic tool. It is used to identify people who may be at risk for health problems associated with being overweight or obese.

BMI does not take into account body composition, which is the ratio of muscle to fat. People who are muscular may have a high BMI even though they have a healthy amount of body fat.

**World Health Organization (WHO)** defines the following BMI categories:
* Underweight: BMI <18.5
* Normal weight: BMI 18.5-24.9
* Overweight: BMI 25-29.9
* Obese: BMI 30-34.9
* Severely obese: BMI â‰¥35
